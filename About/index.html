          <h1 class="head">About</h1>
          <p class="about-para">ðŸ”§I'm a passionate developer with a knack for creating dynamic, user-friendly web experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Adept at problem-solving with C, C++, and SQL, and skilled in foundational data structures and algorithms. Always eager to tackle new challenges and innovate solutions. ðŸš€</p>
        <p class="about-para">As a 3rd-year BCA student, I have developed a deep passion for web development, self-growth, and continuous learning. My journey has been driven by self-motivation, as Iâ€™ve learned web development through YouTube tutorials, web development websites, and hands-on projects. Every mistakeâ€”whether my own or observed in othersâ€”has been an opportunity to grow and improve. This practical learning approach has allowed me to explore the intricacies of programming and web development from a creative and analytical standpoint.</p>
        <p class="about-para">In addition to technical skills, I place great emphasis on personal development. I am constantly working on self-growth, including influencing and learning from others around me. Whether it's participating in debates, workshops, or events, I am passionate about challenging myself and gaining new perspectives. Attending seminars, lectures, and programs has provided me with a platform to network, learn from industry professionals, and stay updated on the latest trends.</p>
        <p class="about-para">My educational journey is not only about academic achievements, but also about enriching myself with good and bad experiences alike. I believe in learning from every aspect of life and am determined to take every opportunity to broaden my horizons in both the technical and personal development fields.</p>
